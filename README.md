#### INTEGRATION

The "Snowball" Action is a [GitHub Action][1] designed to validate a provided
Semantic Version. The "Snowball" Action is based upon the GitHub Action for
Docker which uses a Docker Image to execute the GitHub Action step.

To integrate the "Snowball" Action within your Github Workflow you need to
add the following steps within your Github Workflow File:

```yml
- name: Validate Semantic Version
  uses: ShaidK/Snowball@v0.12.0
  with:
      version: '<VERSION_TO_VALIDATE>'
```

#### INPUT

The "Snowflake Action" requires the Input Parameter: `version`. The Input
Parameter defines the string which need to be validated by Semantic
Versioning.

#### OUTPUT

The "Snowball" Action will output if the Version Validates to Semantic
Versioning or Error if it doesn't.

#### USAGE

The following is an example usage of the "Snowball" Action to validate
the Semantic Version string:

```yml
jobs:
    validate_version:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: Validate Semantic Version
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v6
              with:
                  fetch-depth: 0

            - name: Validate Semantic Version
              uses: ShaidK/Snowflake@v0.12.0
              with:
                  version: 'V0.12.0'
```
